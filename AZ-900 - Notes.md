# Wrong answer from AZ Tests

- Increasing the capacity of an application by adding additional virtual machine is called¬†horizontal scaling
- You have an Azure virtual machine that is accessed only between 9:00 and 17:00 each day. What should you do to minimize costs but preserve the associated hard disks and data?
    - Deallocate the virtual machine.
- MFA > Azure Policy
- Provisioning JSON Format ARM Templates
- Azure Advisor > recommendations to improve reliability, security, performance and cost reduction
