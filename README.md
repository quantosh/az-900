# My AZ-900 Exam Study Documentation Repository

Welcome to my personal repository! Here, I'm documenting my study journey as I prepare for the Microsoft AZ-900 certification exam. This repository serves as a record of my study process and integration with Notion, in case it's helpful to others seeking similar resources.

**Repository Contents:**
- Progress logs detailing my study sessions and topics covered.
- Notes, summaries, and mind maps on key Azure concepts.
- Screenshots and examples of how I've integrated my study plan with Notion.

**Purpose of This Repository:**
I've created this repository to keep track of my progress and resources while studying for the AZ-900 exam. It's intended for personal use, but I'm making it public in case it's of interest or inspiration to others who are also preparing for this exam or using Notion for study organization.

Feel free to explore the contents and how I've used Notion to structure my study process. If you find any aspect useful, please adapt it to your needs. Keep in mind that this repository is primarily for my personal documentation, but I'm happy to share my approach with the community.
