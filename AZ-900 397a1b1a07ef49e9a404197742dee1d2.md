        - **Resources**
            - V**ertical scaling**, scaling up / down, change the scale of your resource
            - H**orizontal scaling:** adding more resources to env
    - **Elasticity**
        - The ability to scale dynamically
    - **Agility**
        - The ability to react quickly, allocate and deallocate (scale) resources quickly
    - **Fault Tolerance**

    - **Disaster Recovery** is a serious disruption of services caused by a natural or human-induced causes
        - The ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service (disaster)
        - Use replication to avoid lose information
    - **High Availability**
